#    Resize (grow) 3rd partition.
#

#
# first the 4th parition needs to shrink
#


#  1. Shrink filesystem


#  2. Check filesystem for errors. If possible, fix them

#  3. Move filesystem to the right
#
#     -r : create raw image file (instead of normal one).
#     -a : include all data
#     -O : offset when writing data
#     -p : show progress

# sudo e2image -ra -p -O $((5*1024*1024)) /dev/${device}4 img


#  5. Shrink partition 4
#
#     This operation consists of two steps:
#     First, the fourth partition needs to be removed.
#     Second: a new partition is recreated with a new start.
#


# sudo e2image -I img /dev/${device}4


#  6. Grow partition 3
#
#     For a reason that's beyond me, if a partition's size is
#     changed but it keeps the same start, it can be done
#     with one operation: resize
#
#     Unfortunately, there's a bug with resize so that the -s flag
#     cannot be used (https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/202872/6479)
#       $exec_parted  resizepart  4  â€¦
#
#
# $exec_parted unit B resizepart 3  $(( $part_4_start_new - 1 ))  Yes


# $exec_parted        resizepart 3  $(( $part_4_start_new - 1 ))b Yes

# $exec_parted unit B resizepart 3 Yes  $(( $part_4_start_new - 1 ))
# sudo $parted_executable /dev/$device 3 Yes $(( $part_4_start_new - 1 ))




#  4. Check filesystem for errors again.

#  .... grow partition to 10 M again???

#  5. Move filesystem to the right
#
#     -r : create raw image file (instead of normal one).
#     -a : include all data
#     -O : offset when writing data
#     -p : show progress
